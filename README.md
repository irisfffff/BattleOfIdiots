# BattleOfIdiots
This project is a multiplayer Augmented Reality (AR) game developed with Unity and Vuforia.

## Motivation
The aim of the project is to explore the use of multiple modalities in a design endeavour.

## Aim
Make use of different modalities in a collaboration game form. Each player would be assigned a mini game and they are supposed to finish within time limit in order to win.

## Process
In this project, marker based AR is achieved using Vuforia framework and multiplayer is supported by Unity's built-in UNET service. The game can be built on either iOS device, Android device or laptop. Default time limit is 2 mins and player amount is three, game would only start when all three players are connected one of which acts as game host.

## Deployment
The first game is Roll A Ball adapted from Unity's 3D game tutorial, using touchscreen to manipulate on smartphone device. The according marker is the reindeer. (https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial)
The second game assigned to the wolf is a ball maze controlled by gravity. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXNjNcqW4kY&t=860s)
The third game has two markers, the butterfly stands for a AR drone (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/scifi-enemies-and-vehicles-15159) and owl triggers AR target cubes in the playerâ€™s camera view. Players tap the screen to shoot bullets from the drone to destroy the cubes. (https://blog.theknightsofunity.com/unity-vuforia-guide/)
